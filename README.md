# Bose-Hubbard-Model
This is a part of my project on Bose-Hubbard Model and the primary goal here is to make a phase diagram and find where the superfluid changes to Mott insulator. The Bose-Hubbard model is a simple model that describes interacting bosons on a lattice. The Hamiltonian for the Bose-Hubbard model is given by:
